The easiest way to install the font is to download the ZIP file (under the green "Code" button), unpack it and copy the LICENSE and the OTF files into your local font directory. You may also copy the entire unzipped directory there. Some systems have an automatized way of installing fonts, you just have to click the OTF file in your file manager; in this case, you may lose the location of the LICENSE, so you may want to save it manually either way.
